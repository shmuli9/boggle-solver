## Boggle Solving algorithm written in Go

### Very much a work in progress right now, and not yet functional

I am trying to port my Python algorithm from [here](https://github.com/shmuli9/WebBoggle), in order to better learn Go.

The Python algo isn't overly complicated, but it is not trivial either and touches on a great deal of Python's features, and thought this would be a good crash course for learning Go!
